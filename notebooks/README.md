# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and experimentation.

## Organization

- `01_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb` - Initial data exploration and visualization
- `02_feature_engineering.ipynb` - Feature creation and selection experiments
- `03_model_experiments.ipynb` - Model training and comparison experiments
- `04_results_analysis.ipynb` - Final model results and interpretation

## Kaggle Code

Save any notebooks from the Kaggle dataset's "Code" section here for reference.

## Best Practices

1. Number notebooks in the order they should be run
2. Keep notebooks focused on a single topic or experiment
3. Extract reusable code to `src/` modules
4. Document insights and findings in markdown cells
5. Clear outputs before committing (unless results are important to preserve)
